# RSE18-Python-Parallel-workshop

The `install_log.txt` contains all the steps used to set up the VM (apt installs, conda install etc)

The `package-list.txt` lists all the conda packages installed in the environment.

The tests to check the packages are working correctly are in the `test_workshop_VM` folder

 - Run the script `run_all_workshop_tests.sh` from that directory.
 - They can also be run individually from within each subdirectory if needed.
 - The full correct outputs are in `test_correct_ouput_log.txt`
 - There should be no Python tracebacks or import errors if everything runs correctly.
