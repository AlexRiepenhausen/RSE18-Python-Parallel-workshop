    "# Part 2: Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is another Python package designed to offer increased performance with Python applications that use a lot of `numpy` code for computation. Numba is a 'just-in-time' compiler for numpy code - it works by compiling your numpy code at runtime into optimised machine code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numba works best on numpy code that can be encapsulated neatly into separate, minimal functions, such as performing operations on arrays, or code with loops. Numba is most commonly used with python decorators, which are placed above the function you wish to optimise through just-in-time compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely see perfomance gains in most numpy code through using numba with its default options and using the commonly applied decorators `@jit`, however, these decorators themselves do not cause numba to run parallel computation (The speed up initially comes from having \"jit-ted\" code.) \n",
    "\n",
    "To exploit the features of parallelism in numba, we have to go beyond the basics of numba, but first lets look at some simple examples of jitted code with numba:\n",

    "We won't go into the details of how numba works in this mini-tutorial, but basically it uses clever heuristics to determine if a loop or other constructs in a function can be parallelised. This means you may not always get speedup using the `parallel=True` argument, as numba's internal logic may have decided that the loop cannot be parallelised or is not worth parallelising. The aim of the numba module is to make parallelisation easy to the end user (by just adding a decorator with a few keyword arguments) but at the expense of hiding a lot of the details of what is going on 'under the hood'. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Explicit parallel loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba will automatically try to detect loops that can be parallelised, but it also gives you the option of creating parallel loops manually. This functionality is provided in the `numba.prange` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `prange` method can be used in place of where you would normally call the python `range` function is used, say in a for loop for example. This tells numba that the for loop is suitable to be parallelised. However, it is up to the user to determine if the loop can be safely parallelised,  i.e. the iterations of the loop should be able to be calculated independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using numba's `prange` a reduction will be inferred automatically if a variable is being updated by a binary function/operator (i.e. `+, -, /, *`). In other words, you do no have to explicitly sum up the separate computations in each parallel task, numba will do this for you.\n",

    "Numba works best when you problem is best decribed by some or all of the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Compute time is primarily due to NumPy array element memory access or numerical operations (integer or float) that are more complex than a single NumPy function call.\n",
    " - Functions which work with data types that are frequently converted by NumPy functions to int64 or float64 for calculations (like int8 and int16).\n",
    " - The function is called many times during normal execution.  Compilation is slow, so if the function is not called more than once, the execution time savings is unlikely to compensate for compilation time.\n",
    " - The function execution time is larger than the Numba dispatcher overhead.  Functions which execute in much less than a microsecond are not going to see a major improvement, as the wrapper code which transitions from the Python interpreter to Numba takes longer than a pure Python function call."
