    "# Part 2: Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is another Python package designed to offer increased performance with Python applications that use a lot of `numpy` code for computation. Numba is a 'just-in-time' compiler for numpy code - it works by compiling your numpy code at runtime into optimised machine code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numba works best on numpy code that can be encapsulated neatly into separate, minimal functions, such as performing operations on arrays, or code with loops. Numba is most commonly used with python decorators, which are placed above the function you wish to optimise through just-in-time compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely see perfomance gains in most numpy code through using numba with its default options and using the commonly applied decorators `@jit`, however, these decorators themselves do not cause numba to run parallel computation (The speed up initially comes from having \"jit-ted\" code.) \n",
    "\n",
    "To exploit the features of parallelism in numba, we have to go beyond the basics of numba, but first lets look at some simple examples of jitted code with numba:\n",
