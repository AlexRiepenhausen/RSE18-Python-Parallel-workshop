    "# Part 4: Parallel programming with Cython\n",

    "Cython is extension of the Python language which provides improved performance similar to compiled C-code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cython is sometimes described as a hybrid-style language mixing Python and C, using  C-like static type definitions to provide the Cython compiler with enough extra information to produce highly-performant code, offering performance similar to traditional C code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mini-tutorial, we are going to look at a particular subset of the Cython project that provides parallel programming support, using the `cython.parallel` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A brief crash course in Cython\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look at the `cython.parallel` module, however, we should cover some basic Cython first to get a feel of how it looks and works compared to pure Python and C code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a programming example favourite - a function that computes the n-th Fibonacci number, taking `n` as its input argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here it is in __Python__"
